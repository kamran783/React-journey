CDN (Content Delivery Network)

Definition:
A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a group of geographically distributed servers that deliver website content to users from the nearest server, instead of a single central server.

Why CDN is used

1.To increase website speed

2.To reduce latency (delay)

3.To reduce load on the main server

4.To improve reliability and security


How CDN works

1.Content is stored on a main (origin) server

2.CDN keeps cached copies of frequently used content on edge servers

3.When a user requests content, it is served from the nearest CDN server

4.If not available, CDN fetches it from the origin server and caches it


1️⃣ Why do we use crossorigin in the <script> tag?

When you load React from a CDN (like unpkg or cdnjs), the file is coming from another domain, not your own website.

Purpose of crossorigin

It tells the browser how to handle cross-origin requests

It allows the browser to share error details if something goes wrong

Without it, React errors may appear as “Script error” with no useful info

In simple words:

crossorigin helps the browser safely load React from another website and show proper error messages during development.

2️⃣ Why do we use two script tags for React?

React is split into two separate libraries, each with a different responsibility.

🔹 First script: React

This is the core React library.

It handles:

Components

JSX conversion (conceptually)

State

Props

Virtual DOM logic

💡 Think of this as:

“React = How UI should look and behave”


🔹 Second script: ReactDOM

This is the bridge between React and the browser DOM.

It handles:

Rendering React elements to the actual HTML page

Updating the real DOM efficiently

💡 Think of this as:

“ReactDOM = Putting React UI into the browser”


Why not a single file?

React can be used outside the browser (mobile apps, server rendering)

ReactDOM is browser-specific

Separation keeps React platform independent


3️⃣ What is React.createElement()?

This is the core function of React.

What it does:

Creates a React element object

This object represents what you want to see on the screen

It does NOT create real HTML directly

Important concept:

React does not work with HTML — it works with JavaScript objects

So React.createElement():

Describes UI in object form

Stores element type, attributes, and children

Feeds this info into React’s rendering system

💡 JSX is just a shortcut for React.createElement().


4️⃣ What is ReactDOM.createRoot()?

This is how React connects itself to the actual webpage (introduced in React 18).

What it does:

Creates a root container

Tells React where to render your UI

Enables modern features like concurrent rendering

In simple terms:

createRoot() creates a starting point where React controls the UI.

After this:

React manages everything inside that root

Updates are fast and 


5️⃣ Big Picture Summary (Interview-friendly)

crossorigin → Allows safe CDN loading and better error debugging

Two script tags →

React = UI logic

ReactDOM = Browser rendering

React.createElement() → Converts UI into React objects

ReactDOM.createRoot() → Connects React to the real DOM
